            <p class="text-slate-400">Last updated: October 14, 2025</p>

            <p>SpotOrigin ("us", "we", or "our") operates the SpotOrigin website (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>

            <h2>2. Use of Data</h2>
            <p>SpotOrigin uses the collected data for various purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide and maintain our Service</li>
                <li>To facilitate the core function of the marketplace, which involves connecting Candidates, Agents, and Companies.</li>
                <li>To manage your account and your registration as a user of the Service.</li>
                <li>To contact you by email, telephone calls, or other equivalent forms of electronic communication.</li>
                <li>To provide you with news, special offers, and general information about other goods, services, and events which we offer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Disclosure of Data</h2>
            <p>Your data is shared within the SpotOrigin marketplace only as necessary to provide the Service:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>To Companies:</strong> An Agent may share a Candidate's information with a Company after identifying a potential match for a specific job opening. We do not operate a public resume database.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will not share your personal information with any third party outside of this core service without your explicit consent, except as required by law.</p>

            <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
