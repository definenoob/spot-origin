            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p class="text-slate-400">Last updated: October 14, 2025</p>

            <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the SpotOrigin website (the "Service") operated by SpotOrigin ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
            <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service.</p>
            <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you do not have permission to access the Service.</p>

            <h2>1. Accounts</h2>
            <p>When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above the age of 18, and that the information you provide us is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete information may result in the immediate termination of your account on the Service.</p>
            <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you agree to accept responsibility for any and all activities or actions that occur under your account and/or password.</p>

            <h2>2. The Service</h2>
            <p>SpotOrigin provides a marketplace to connect three parties: "Candidates" (individuals seeking employment), "Companies" (entities seeking to hire), and "Agents" (individuals or AI-powered services that match Candidates to Companies).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Candidates:</strong> By uploading your information, you agree to allow verified Agents on the platform to view your profile and contact you regarding potential job opportunities.</li>
                <li><strong>Agents:</strong> You agree to use the platform's data ethically and only for the purpose of matching Candidates with Companies. Commission structures and payment terms will be governed by a separate Agent Agreement.</li>
                <li><strong>Companies:</strong> You agree to provide accurate information about job openings and to interact professionally with Candidates introduced by Agents.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>SpotOrigin's role is to facilitate these connections. We are not a party to any employment agreement subsequently negotiated between a Candidate and a Company.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The Service and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of SpotOrigin and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Termination</h2>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.</p>
            
            <h2>5. Limitation Of Liability</h2>
            <p>In no event shall SpotOrigin, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.</p>

            <h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

            <h2>7. Changes</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>

            <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us by email at: <a href="mailto:legal@spotorigin.com">legal@spotorigin.com</a></p>
